# Gif-initions

Gif-initions is a user input dynamic word search used to display words into interactive .GIF graphics.

# Description

In this project, our task was to create a real-world front-end application using at least two server-side APIs.

When the user selects the **Random Word** button, a random word is generated, and related word information and related GIFS are generated via APIs. The user is able to view word information and GIFS in collapsible tabs.

The user can select the the **Random Word** button again to generate a new word, information and GIFS.
